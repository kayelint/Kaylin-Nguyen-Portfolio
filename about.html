                                <hr>
                                <p>Hi, I am Kaylin Nguyen, a senior studying data science and statistics at Northwestern University. With a passion for leveraging data to solve real-world problems, I focus on machine learning and statistical analysis. When I'm not working on data-driven projects, you can find me practicing fencing as a NCAA Division 1 student-athlete or exploring new ways to improve organizational processes. My interest in technology and analytics extends beyond the classroom, as I enjoy developing projects that contribute to real-world applications. I am currently working on neural networks, sentiment analysis, and Hugging Face transformers.</p>

                                <hr>
                                <p>This past summer, I interned at IBM as a Customer Success Manager (CSM) AI Architect, focusing on the new agentic AI implementation in IBM’s webMethods Hybrid Integration.
                                    In the past, I've had the opportunity to work on diverse projects that span industries and challenges. 
                                    At <a href="https://lmha.me" target="_blank" style="color: black">Lay Mental Health Advocates</a>, I served as a Data and Web Development Analyst, advancing the organization's mission through innovative technology solutions by implementing Python modules (through scikit-learn, PyTorch, spaCy, and so many more Python libraries) to perform survey and sentiment analysis as well as advocate-patient matching, complete with statistical testing and automated reporting for streamlined decision-making.
                                    At Webacy, I delved into blockchain security, analyzing smart contract vulnerabilities and applying unsupervised machine learning techniques to uncover patterns in risk data.
                                    With Mobalytics, I explored the intersection of gaming and data by researching player psychology, analyzing social media trends, and crafting strategies for market expansion. At IBM, I deepened my knowledge of cutting-edge technologies like
                                    Blockchain, AI, and IoT, while leading a team to design a chatbot solution that slashed operational costs by 95%.

                                <hr>
                                <p>My passion for data-driven work extends beyond my career, as I’ve applied it in various projects. For example, I volunteered as a Data Entry Specialist in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, where I helped collect and manage health data for over 2,000 patients. I also worked on an Airbnb booking prediction project, achieving 94% accuracy by developing predictive models with machine learning techniques. Additionally, I analyzed Twitch streamer data, exploring the relationship between age-restricted content and viewer engagement, as well as the impact of follower count on watch time. I thrive on transforming data into actionable insights, both in my work and personal projects.
                                    Outside of my professional and academic endeavors, I enjoy staying active with hobbies like sunrise hiking, reading, spending time with my girlfriend and friends, and running around Chicago searching for the best chai latte (at the moment, it's Coffee Lab in Evanston!).
